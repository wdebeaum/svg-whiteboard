= bugfixes
 # make undo/redo apply to size/color changes
 # copy tool breaks when trying to copy arrow-connected objects
 # disabling fisheye panning in Firefox temporarily breaks the pan tool until another tool is activated
 # panning with the scroll wheel/gesture doesn't pan the selection
 - selection doesn't show in greyed out fisheye border
  > because the shadow filter only goes as far as the screen area
 - "move" icon alignment on Firefox
 X don't XML-escape imported text files (readAsText seems to do this in Chrome but not Firefox?)
  > no, just old versions?
 ? delete sometimes doesn't work?
 ? sometimes head object of arrow can't be found?
 - see FIXME comments on moveObjects, maybe related to above two
 ? trashcan vs. eraser
 - small text is smaller on Chrome than on Firefox?!
 # make relay.pl use POST instead of GET... think I might be losing messages due to browsers trying to be too smart about same-origin testing
  > still losing messages?

= enhancements of existing features
 X make new open a new tab/window with a blank document (using data URI) instead of clearing the current document
  > would make it inconsistent with "open"
 # import text files as well as images (using current text tool settings)
 # import on drop event
 - resize imported images
  ? add a handle when selected
  # set of scale factors corresponding to pen/text sizes
 ? calibration boxes for scroll wheel/gesture for pan/zoom
 - preview fisheye border settings
 ? size palette settings
 ? place text cursor where you clicked when reopening texts
 - zoom level selector
 - make the zoom level indicator take less horizontal space
 - multitouch pinch to zoom (multitouch pan should already work via scroll events)
  > waiting to get access to a device with a multitouch screen
 ? should changing the selection count as an action for undo/redo?

= new features
 # license
  > I'd like to include a public domain dedication, but I want to make it clear that only the application is in the public domain; anything you create with it doesn't have to be, and you shouldn't have to dig into it and remove the dedication
  > maybe it would suffice to have a separate license file in the repo and a link to it in the main file?
 # undo/redo list
  # ^Z ^Y keyboard shortcuts
  # buttons next to delete
 ? clipboard interaction with SVG objects (not just text in textToolInput)
  > complicated by browser security considerations
  ? ^X ^C ^V keyboard shortcuts
 # collaboration via WebRTC/STUN/TURN/ICE/acronym-of-the-week
  # unhide collaboration settings by default (once it's more polished)
  # document it in help text and README
  # add corresponding section to settings
  ? separate menu item for collaboration settings
  # text chat inset
   ? A/V chat as well
  # more than two users
   # star topology, hub relays messages
    ? when hub leaves, switch to the next user on the list as the hub
   X completely connected graph, everyone sends only their own messages, to everyone else
    > not scalable
   # make add/remove user buttons work
  # add/remove users on the fly (while already collaborating)
   # send notification to other users about new users joining
  - overall collaboration status indicator
   > text chat bar sort of serves this purpose now
  - merge start/stop collaborating buttons
  - notice when a connection drops, give option to restart it (or just try automatically continuously)
   > in this case, the two sides share most of the same state already, so sending the full document back and forth would be bad
  - show for each user:
   - their currently selected color/size/tool
   # connection status (disconnected/connecting/connected and active/connected but idle)
   ? personal icon or generic silhouette fallback
  # implement signaling relay fallback option
  ? what to do when two users start collaborating, both with nonempty documents?
   - resolve ID conflicts
   - what if the diagrams overlap (which they probably will if they both start at the origin)?
 - move tool drag from either end of an arrow = move just that end (switch back to arrow tool? or just use arrow tool for this instead of move?)
  ? need marker for tail of arrow
 ? allow arrows to other arrows
  > harder than other objects because movement becomes recursive
